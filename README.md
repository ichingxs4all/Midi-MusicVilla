Worskhop examples MIDI MusicVilla

These example work are based on a setup with an Arduino Leonardo and a Seeed Grove shield.
The sensors used are a potentiometer connected to analog port 0 (A0), a lightsensor connected to analog port 1 (A1), a led connected to digital pin 3 (D3).
A touchbutton sensor is connected to digital pin 6 (D6) and a distance sensor is connected to I2C.

The libaries need are the FortySevenEffects Arduino MIDI library
https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library

and the Adafruit VL53L0X library
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VL53L0X

Best practice is to look for them through the library manager and install them through that.
